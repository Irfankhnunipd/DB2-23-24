\subsection{REST API Summary}

% The rest API is studied to experiment with multiple different approaches to the REST paradigm. More in detail, endpoints associated with rides and devices are developed in a more traditional way, with the entirety of the information needed to satisfy the request directly in the URI.
% Other endpoints require additional information (such as the type of operation required) as additional parameters in the request.\\

% Part of the URIs are filtered through different filters. M indicates that only users with the role of maintainer can access to the endpoint, B indicates that only builders can access the endpoint, A that only administrators can request the specified URI to the server.
